# Hi there, I'm Sharad ðŸ‘‹

I used to code, but for the past couple years I've been doing DevOps and DevSecOps work as a consultant.  It's fun but I haven't really worked on anything I can put here in a long while.  I aim to change that.

## Currently working on

Implementing a pipeline to deploy IaC to aws.  If I can get 2 microservices deploying and talking to each other, I'll call it a win.  At this stage, not sure what those 2 microservices will be.
